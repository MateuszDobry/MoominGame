MoominGame

MoominGame is an interactive adventure set in the Moomin universe, where players take on the role of Moomintroll. 
The objective of the game is to explore the Moomin Valley, interact with various creatures, and manage the character's health and experience. 
Players control Moomintroll, who has specific statistics: health, friendship level, level, and experience. 
Moomintroll starts with 100 health points and can gain experience through interactions with other characters. 
The game features various creatures, such as the Groke, Hattifattener, and Stinky, each with different moods and patience levels.
Encounters with these creatures are random, and their mood affects interactions. Players can choose from different actions, such as talking, running away, or using an item. 
Throughout the game, players can collect items that restore health and gain experience, allowing for level-ups. The game ends when Moomintroll's health drops to zero.
Additionally, players keep a journal that records all encounters with the creatures they meet.
